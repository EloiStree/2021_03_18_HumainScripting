# 2021_03_18_HumainScripting
I often fall on an idea that is bad but good at the same time: Human Scriptiong. This repo is just me dropping the idea to come to it later.


It makes four time that I think about that during my coding drifting. So I think it is important to write it down for later.


The is is stupide. Human write script and program to give order and request to the computer.
But more the AI is becoming important, more we will need the inverse to be possible:
The AI asking human tasks that it can't do and request to random human to do it (for money or not).

If we decide to create that... How should we write this scripting communication and how could we make it easy to implement in any services.

Why I am thinking about that ?

When I coding Open Macro Input that allows to triggers action, I realized that some actions are only doable by human or too long to code.
So I would like to have macro that do all he can without my need but can call me and queue human actions that are needed to be executed.
Example:
- Did you read your mail (y/n) ?
- What is the name of the guys playing with you (name,...,name) ?
- Could you resolve this captcha (iamge)() ? 
- Is this guy look friendly ? 
- How do you field about this guy (canbetrusted, could not be wise, don't trust him ?)
- Could you loggin on your facebooka count (done, not now, stop linked task)?
- Could you give web page with information on this subject that you consider good enough ?
- ...
